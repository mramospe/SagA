This package provides utilities to study point-to-point interactions of many-body problems.
These interactions can be, for example, of gravitational or electromagnetic nature.
The classes and functions provide interfaces to control the precision of the calculations as well as the system of units.
Right now, objects and functions are only implemented for CPU backends, but the goal in the future is to give support to run also on GPUs.
